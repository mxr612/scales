  The Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL90) is a 90-item questionnaire used to assess psychological problems. The Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL90R) is the revised version of the questionnaire. The revised version is almost identical (2 questions with slightly different wording), but the main difference is that the SCL90R is not available on the public domain.
